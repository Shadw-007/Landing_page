# Landing_page

In this project I am supposed to create a landing page using the instructions given to me, the previous work that I have done and, of course... AUNTY GOOGLE!!! With all of these aids at my disposal I should make the landing page look as similar as the 'desired outcome'.
Let's see how it goes.

Shout out goes to Drew Beamer for the image in teh first section of the webpage! Catch him on Twitter @beamomatic9000 or check out his website https://dribbble.com/beamomatic9000

The pictures from the second section come from Ray Piedra, JD Danny, and Mnz. If you get the chance look them up on social media!
